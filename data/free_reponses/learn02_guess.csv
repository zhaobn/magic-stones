"1",25,"The magic ones change the shape of the normal ones"
"2",30,"I still don't have much of a clue. I thought at first it might simply switch from circle to square then back to circle, but that left out the possibility of diamond...then I thought there might be an order (if at first the normal stone is a square, then the diamond magic stone changes it to a circle, and if the normal one's a circle, it becomes a diamond, so it would be square -> circle -> diamond)Finally, I thought perhaps it would change into the shape that's not represented in the original matching (so a magic diamond would turn a square to a circle, a magic circle would turn a diamond to a square, etc) but that wouldn't work if you had a magic circle and a magic circle, so that was out. The only thing I felt was right was that the color of the original normal stone didn't change when it was transmuted. Other than that, I'm almost as clueless as when I started!"
"3",42,"It just change it's shape from circle,square and hexagon"
"4",45,"The magic will toggle the other shape back and forth between two states."
"5",46,"The diamond rounds the corners of the regular stones, and it has the opposite effect on circles. Others turn the stones into squares/diamonds. I am only sure about the first part since I was only shown that effect."
"6",79,"I think squares turn into circles"
"7",87,"The magic stone removes or adds edges to the shape of the regular rock, depending on the regular rock's starting shape"
"8",88,"I have no idea at all. I really can't even answer this as I don't know.  "
"9",89,"Magic shape changes the shape of the regular shape but the color stays the same. If the magic stone is a different shape, it changes the regular one to an unused shape of the same color."
