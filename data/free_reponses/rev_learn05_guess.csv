"8",139,"I thought at first that the rules were a. the magic stone turns the other stone to the same color as the magic stone is (ie yellow diamond turns purple square yellow) and b. it turns the regular stone into the shape that neither of them were initially (ie yellow diamond turns purple square into a circle.) This kind of went askew when I saw ones that were the same color (eg a pink circle and a pink square) or had the same shape (eg a magic square and a regular square) but I couldn't find any other rule that would fit the initial example, so I continued to work with my initial assumption. Curious about the actual rule!"
