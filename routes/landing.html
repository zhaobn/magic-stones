                <p>Some stones are magic stones, and some are normal stones.</p>
                <p>A magic stone is indicated by having a border, like this:</p>
                <div class="magic-stone"></div>
                <p>And a normal stone does not have borders, like this:</p>
                <div class="normal-stone"></div>
                <br>
                <p>For all the magic stones and normal stones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>their shape can be
                        circle <div class="stone-yc" style="display: inline-block; height: 20px; width: 20px; margin: 0;"></div> ,

                    </li>
                    <li>their color can be
                        <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-weight: bold;">red</span>,
                        <span style="color: rgb(245, 230, 99); font-weight: bold;">yellow</span>, or
                        <span style="color: rgb(61, 60, 134); font-weight: bold;">blue</span>;
                    </li>
                    <li>stones differ <b>only</b> in their magic power, color, and shape;</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">magic stones can set the color and/or shape of normal stones into specific states.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>As a newcomer to the magic world, you have the chance to watch one specific magic stone's effects on a normal stone.</p>
                <p>After that, you will be facing some other magic stones and normal stones. Give your best prediction at the given magic stone's effects on the given normal stone.</p>
                <p>You will make predictions for 15 pairs of magic stones and normal stones. Between each prediction case, you watch the original effects again as a reminder.</p>
                <p>To help you make accurate predictions, a summary of the original effects you saw will be displayed at the top of the page.</p>
                <p>Hint: All the stones are in the same magic world and share the same magic rule.</p>
                <p>Think carefully. You earn a 10 cent bonus whenever you make a correct prediction.</p>
