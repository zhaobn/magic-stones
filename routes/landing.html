                <p>Some stones are magic stones, and some are normal stones.</p>
                <p>A magic stone is indicated by having a border, like this:</p>
                <div class="magic-stone"></div>
                <p>And a normal stone does not have borders, like this:</p>
                <div class="normal-stone"></div>
                <br>
                <p>For all the magic stones and normal stones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>their color can be red, yellow, or blue;</li>
                    <li>their shape can be circle, square, or diamond;</li>
                    <li>all stones are of the same size; and</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">magic stones can change the color and/or shape of normal stones.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>As a newcomer to the magic world, you have the chance to watch how one specific magic stone changes a normal stone.</p>
                <p>After that, you will be facing some other magic stones and normal stones. Give your best prediction at how the given magic stone changes the given normal stone.</p>
                <p>You can consult the effects you saw by scolling up to the top of the page.</p>
                <p>Hint: All the stones are in the same magic world and share the same magic rule.</p>
                <p>Think carefully. Whenever you make a correct prediction, you earn a 10 cent bonus.</p>
