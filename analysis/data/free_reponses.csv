I thought at first it might simply switch from circle to square then back to circle, but that left out the possibility of diamond...then I thought there might be an order (if at first the normal stone is a square, then the diamond magic stone changes it to a circle, and if the normal one's a circle, it becomes a diamond, so it would be square -> circle -> diamond)Finally, I thought perhaps it would change into the shape that's not represented in the original matching (so a magic diamond would turn a square to a circle, a magic circle would turn a diamond to a square, etc) but that wouldn't work if you had a magic circle and a magic circle, so that was out. The only thing I felt was right was that the color of the original normal stone didn't change when it was transmuted. Other than that, I'm almost as clueless as when I started!","5392e544-a1fc-4740-97c7-61343d418cde"
